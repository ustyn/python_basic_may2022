# LESSON 3
## List comprehension
The syntax of the list comrehension looks like:
`[<expression> for <item> in <iterable> | if <condition>]`

List comprehension may perform or may not perform operation with element.

List comprehension may contain or may not contain additional condition.

Watch and try some examples:
1. Get odd numbers from some collection 

 ( comprehension with some condition) 
```python
# some range from 10 to 100 with step 5
all_numbers = range(10, 100, 5)  

# get only odd numbers from previous range
odd_numbers = [i for i in all_numbers if i % 2 != 0]
```
2. Create the list of squares from some collection

 ( comprehension with some operation with every element) 
```python
squares = [item**2 for item in range(20)]
```

3. Print elements from collection without using for loop
   
(for example, print all methods that we can perform with <**list**>, except 'magic' methods )
```python
_ = [print(method) for method in dir(list) if not method.startswith('__')]
```


## Ternary operator
To make one line readable conditions.

`var = true_val if condition else false_val`

Examples. 

Copy and try to see how it works with different values. 

```python
is_after_12 = True      # change to False and watch result
print(f'Now is {"PM" if is_after_12 else "AM"} time.')
```

```python
user_ids = [1, 2, 3]      # change to empty list
message = f'Total {len(user_ids)} users in the list.' if user_ids else 'No users.'
print(message)
```

## Home Task hints
* Copy two `.py` files to a folder `lesson_3`. You need to import and use hardcoded values from `helper.py`.
* Try to run `collections_lesson.py` and watch AssertionError.
* The line like `assert condition , message` checks the condition and if it is False , raises an Error with message. Assertions are widely used in tests.
* Your task is to fix two cases marked **Fixme:**, and make the file run up to the end without Assertion or other errors
* DO NOT correct assertions, correct the code to make Assertions valid.

NOTE: Max points for this task is 90 and absolutely normal and OK.
To get + 10 points more, create the correct cities list without None in a single line.
Yes, actions **# 3** and **# 4** may be completed in a single line, do it to get +10 points.
Your correct result will be a list (or set) with values :
`'Kings Landing', 'Braavos', 'Dragon Stone', 'Winterfell', 'Casterly Rock'`.
